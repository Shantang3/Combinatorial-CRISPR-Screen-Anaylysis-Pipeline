# Combinatorial CRISPR Screen Anaylysis Pipeline
This pipeline is desinged for data analysis and visulization for the STAR Protocols of "Fast and Efficient Generation of Paired-gRNA Library Facilitates Combinatorial CRISPR Screen for Discovering Synthetic Lethal Gene Pairs".

## 1. Dual-crispr: Mapping and counting for gRNA-gRNA construction
A detailed demonstration of how to install and run Dual-cripsr can be found at: 
https://github.com/ucsd-ccbb/mali-dual-crispr-pipeline 

## 2.Quality control:
Mainly focus on the statistics of sequecing, count distribution and sample correlation, 
Please refer to QC folder.

## 3. LogFC calculation and hit identification

## 4. Visulization
